# Embedded_Systems_1_project

Accelerometer usage:
- Communication with the accelerator located on the "multisensor" hat via SPI
- Saving readings via DMA
- Data processing
- Displaying processed measurements from a given axis on a 7-segment display (with the option of changing the axis after pressing the button)
- Sending read data via UART to an external device (PC or, if enough time, a board based on the Zynq system)

Hardware:
- Nucleo-64 F411 development board
- KA-Nucleo-Multisensor expander hat
